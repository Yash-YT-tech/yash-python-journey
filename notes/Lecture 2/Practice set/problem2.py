# Problem 2 : Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z

num_1 = int(input("Enter number :"))
z = int(input("Enter number to divide : "))

remainder = num_1 % z
# print("when" num_1 "is divided be" z "the remainder is : ", remainder)
print("The remainder is :",remainder)
